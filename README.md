# Pull Request Template

This is an example of `pull_request_template.md`

## Motivation 
This is a place where you should describe your steps, what you added, changed, or removed. Solution description is like a journal, where you will describe your steps or explain your idea.

## Testing steps
Here you should add all testing steps for your reviewers.
For Example

- [ ] Test UI layer
- [ ] Test Functional layer

## Jira Ticker
Here add a link to the ticket, if you don’t have Jira add to another one service.

## Did you test this issue on all browsers?
This is a place for a checklist, and this section makes sure your reviewer that you tested your solution, if you don’t test on the web, add another list.
